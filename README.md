    Welcome to the Daniel-Rizotto store design template!

This design template is built using HTML and CSS and provides a basic structure for your online store. It includes a navigation bar, header section, main content section, and footer section.

To use this template, simply edit the HTML and CSS files to replace the placeholder content with your own branding, product information, and design elements. You can also add additional HTML and CSS code to further customize the template to meet your needs.
